  ## Description

  This project demonstrates advanced skills in the backend side of development through an e-commerce site. This was done by taking a working Express.js API and configuring it to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database. The POST, PUT, and DELETE routes for products and tags were tested in Insomnia Core. This project uses express, mysql, sequelize and insomnia.
